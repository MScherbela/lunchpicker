				"text": "In case you're unfamiliar with cooking large amounts of pasta, here's the step-by-step-guide. The whole process will take 20-30 minutes:\n*0. Check the lunch-channel* to see whether any guests not using the lunch-bot are joining in as well\n*1. Make sure we have sufficient pasta* and sauce. Check in the kitchen and Michael's office. If we've run out, please buy some and refund yourself from the piggy bank\n*2. Preheat the water with the kettle*. The hot-plate is not powerful enough to heat a huge pot of pasta in a reasonable amount of time\n*3. Add salt and pasta to the boiling water*: For N_PEOPLE_PLACEHOLDER you will need *ca. GRAM_PASTA_PLACEHOLDER grams of pasta*. The large pot can handle up to 1250g\n*4. Watch the pot* Do not leave the pot unattended and avoid large amounts of pasta water spilling onto the hot-plate. It was the cheapest on Amazon and probably does not react well to water on poorly insulated 230V lines.\n*5. Preheat the sauces* if you're serving anything else than pesto. Microwave will be just fine.\n*6. Clean up afterwards* Being on pasta-duty includes ensuring a clean kitchen afterwards. No harm in others helping, but you're responsible for not leaving a mess"
